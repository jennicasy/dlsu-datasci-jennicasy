While I\\'m no expert on slavery, that sure sounds like slavery to me.    \\nAnd keep in mind: while the prince might\\'ve been indoctrinated with this misunderstanding about what slavery entails, the protagonist is a modern Korean girl who loves to rag on the prince with thought bubbles. Yet somehow, she doesn\\'t see anything wrong with this.    \\n\\n\\nMy theory is that the author thinks that slaves are only used for sex and sadistic abuse, as is often seen in manga and manhua alike to either muster sympathy or to build up a villain. Even though - historically - slaves were *primarily* used for agricultural work. \\n\\nSomeone should link the author [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_labor_in_the_United_States#Prison_Labor_Post-13th_Amendment_\\\\(1865%E2%80%931866\\\\)), because it sure sounds oddly familiar.\\n\\n-\\n\\nAnyway, I just wanted to put this out there. I don\\'t really care about the opinion of the author on slavery, but I thought this scene was funny/interesting enough to share.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Some otome isekais have the reincarnated one remember their previous lives when they were kids, and trying to change everything from that point to avoid the event where they are called out for being a bully, and exiled or killed, while others have them remember just at that point, having to deal with the mistakes her other self did. We can see the differences in the Hamefura OG story and its spinoff (Except they more or less go in the same direction after that, but I digress). \\n\\nWell, this manga seems to wants to have their cake, and eat it too. The villainess remembers who she was right at the event where she would have been exiled, but thanks to her memories she is able to get into a more favorable \"punishment\". That\\'s the second route, the adult timeline, the hard mode. Except she has a maid that loves her. We\\'ll that\\'s fine, I mean, even a villainess might have one or two people who love her and think she is a good person. Except it is not just her, she suddenly has more and more allies. There are like five characters introduced that are loyal to her to their deaths, she maxed our their social links (tm). And then they met up with another one, and in the chapter I\\'m reading, there is yet another one, a chef. \\n\\nThey are all mentioned to be orphans who she picked up. She met ALL of them before she got her memories back, when she was the villainess, spoiled noble daughter, no modern japan salarywoman influencing her at all. And granted, it is possible she was a nice person, a saint even, and being branded as a villainess was all situation. Who wouldn\\'t bully a girl who is stealing your man, right gurlz? Ugh, I feel dirty...\\n\\nMy point is that, they skipped the part of the reincarnated one making bonds when she was a kid, but still made them happen \"off-screen\". Once again going with the Bakatarina example, it is like if the spin-off happened, but she was still friends with Sophia and Marie and everyone else, something that only happened because she acted different from her villainess role. \\n\\nI don\\'t think it is a bad reading though, it has lots of chapters and it is moderately entertaining, but it was bothering me, and I feel that whenever she needs something, a new character will pop up and she\\'ll say, \"oh, that\\'s just another orphan I picked up and trained for this specific task, I have 200 more.\" Rant off.',\n",
