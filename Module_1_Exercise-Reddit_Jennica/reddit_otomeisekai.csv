1,PeachBlossomBee,1588357979,14,1,"Or at least with a genuine grudging/resentful lead, like in To Be You, Even Just For A Day, a little less so in The Villainess Reverses the Hourglass.

I like stories with characters trying to outwit each other, backstabbings and assassinations, etc but I only see them in stories with romance heavy plots. 

I was enjoying Empress of Another World, (since at first there were minimal feelings, a wily villain, and a morally grey character) but after a while there were just too many uncomfortably gratuitous descriptions that got in the way of the intrigue. 

I’ve accepted that there’s likely going to be romance regardless, but still, any stories where there’s less sappy parts and more political intrigue?",t5_1zqfgn,Any novels/manga heavy on the politics and light on the romance?

The Solution? The subreddit [Wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/OtomeIsekai/wiki/index) and a new sub-page just for **[The List of Otome Isekai Series](https://www.reddit.com/r/OtomeIsekai/wiki/series)**  With a character limit over 500,000, it should take us quote a while to reach it.

So to keep this short: chapter 54 concludes the ""busting the slave trade"" plot-line, and it contains some of the weirdest dialogue I've thus far read in any of these series:

[Entire scene in a strip.](https://i.imgur.com/uLTS8gH.jpg)

Page-by-page transcript:


[pg. 1](https://i.imgur.com/8ced1Lw.jpg)

&gt;**Prince:**  
*We can't just let [the slaves] go.   
They are also at fault for surrendering themselves.*

[pg. 2](https://i.imgur.com/EsIxuwH.png)

&gt;**Prince:**  
*Do you want to release them?   
We can do whatever you want to do.*

[pg. 3](https://i.imgur.com/t3Mbg4C.png)

&gt;**Protagonist:**  
*We still have to give them punishments. How about forced labor?*

[pg. 4](https://i.imgur.com/qdCZZsL.jpg)

&gt;**Prince:**  
*I agree with you.   
Putting them in jail won't have any effect.*

[pg. 5](https://i.imgur.com/XsfVYXD.jpg)

&gt;**Prince:**  
*If they did labor, they can help us with the agriculture business.   
They can also experience the feeling of working like a normal person.*

[pg. 6](https://i.imgur.com/opDswln.jpg)

&gt;**Protagonist:**  
*That's a generous and assertive move.   
Your highness is very smart.*

I'm sure I don't have to explain his flawed logic to you, but just to sum it up: they talk about punishing slaves for surrendering themselves, and the punishment they come up with is forced agricultural labour. While I'm no expert on slavery, that sure sounds like slavery to me.    
And keep in mind: while the prince might've been indoctrinated with this misunderstanding about what slavery entails, the protagonist is a modern Korean girl who loves to rag on the prince with thought bubbles. Yet somehow, she doesn't see anything wrong with this.    


My theory is that the author thinks that slaves are only used for sex and sadistic abuse, as is often seen in manga and manhua alike to either muster sympathy or to build up a villain. Even though - historically - slaves were *primarily* used for agricultural work. 

Someone should link the author [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_labor_in_the_United_States#Prison_Labor_Post-13th_Amendment_\(1865%E2%80%931866\)), because it sure sounds oddly familiar.

-

Anyway, I just wanted to put this out there. I don't really care about the opinion of the author on slavery, but I thought this scene was funny/interesting enough to share.",t5_1zqfgn,[very mild spoilers] Slavery in Justice of Villainous Woman (What It Takes to be a Villainess) chapter 54.

* The Villainess Reverses the Hourglass
* Dr. Elise/Queen with a Scalpel
* Who made me a princess?

I've been disappointed by a lot of series and I noticed that the ones I like tend to have the following characteristics:

* Strong and clever female MC
* MC's main goal is not romance/plot is not driven by romance (generally not a fan of using a pretext to marry the Duke to survive/thwart deaths/avoid marriage)
* Actually uses skills/knowledge of previous life to advantage
* Serious/more mature tone and realistic handling of events
* Setting is not a magic academy/high school

I’m so devastated that they’re stopping translations :(( Does anyone have any recommendations for similar romance/drama novels that frequently updates? I know of Lucia and You’ve Got the Wrong House, Villain which I’m currently reading. Doesn’t have to be transmigration/reincarnation",t5_1zqfgn,Similar novels to Remarried Empress?

I also read a few other Isekais where there were familiars and beast-kin, so I was hoping that ya'll are familiar with more manga that have either really cute animals, or beast-kin. :) 

It doesn't have to be otome or isekai at all! I'm just in the mood to look at art of cute, fluffy (preferably magical) things. ;~;",t5_1zqfgn,"Recommendations for manga with cute animals, familiars, or beast-people?"

103,Rii-,1589373889,5,1,"I'm looking for a series that I stumbled on a few weeks ago but unfortunately forgot to save. I'm almost sure it was a Manga. The MC had reincarnated/transmigrated in the form of a little girl, she ended up on the villain's stairs and he took her in. She became his maid. I'm pretty sure the villain was a demon king who had a half beast half undead body. 

Honestly I've read so many series at this point they kind of run together. Thanks to anyone knows which one I'm remembering!",t5_1zqfgn,Searching For A Series Name
104,FellowOfHorses,1589394410,21,1,I even went to r/otomegames and browsed through the top posts to learn a little bit more. Never played otoge and I really don't intent to. I never really liked shoujo anime/manga either. But I like these power fantasies. I feel they are more realistic character wise than most Isekai. I also like the harems are more slowly built and each lead usually have a role outside being a harem member,t5_1zqfgn,DAE don't play Otome games but still loves these series?

107,James-Sylar,1589434193,13,1,"Some otome isekais have the reincarnated one remember their previous lives when they were kids, and trying to change everything from that point to avoid the event where they are called out for being a bully, and exiled or killed, while others have them remember just at that point, having to deal with the mistakes her other self did. We can see the differences in the Hamefura OG story and its spinoff (Except they more or less go in the same direction after that, but I digress). 

Well, this manga seems to wants to have their cake, and eat it too. The villainess remembers who she was right at the event where she would have been exiled, but thanks to her memories she is able to get into a more favorable ""punishment"". That's the second route, the adult timeline, the hard mode. Except she has a maid that loves her. We'll that's fine, I mean, even a villainess might have one or two people who love her and think she is a good person. Except it is not just her, she suddenly has more and more allies. There are like five characters introduced that are loyal to her to their deaths, she maxed our their social links (tm). And then they met up with another one, and in the chapter I'm reading, there is yet another one, a chef. 

They are all mentioned to be orphans who she picked up. She met ALL of them before she got her memories back, when she was the villainess, spoiled noble daughter, no modern japan salarywoman influencing her at all. And granted, it is possible she was a nice person, a saint even, and being branded as a villainess was all situation. Who wouldn't bully a girl who is stealing your man, right gurlz? Ugh, I feel dirty...

My point is that, they skipped the part of the reincarnated one making bonds when she was a kid, but still made them happen ""off-screen"". Once again going with the Bakatarina example, it is like if the spin-off happened, but she was still friends with Sophia and Marie and everyone else, something that only happened because she acted different from her villainess role. 

I don't think it is a bad reading though, it has lots of chapters and it is moderately entertaining, but it was bothering me, and I feel that whenever she needs something, a new character will pop up and she'll say, ""oh, that's just another orphan I picked up and trained for this specific task, I have 200 more."" Rant off.",t5_1zqfgn,"I'm reading ""Koushaku Reijou no Tashinami"" and it has something that is bothering me."
